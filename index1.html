            <p>80 years ago marked the beginning of one of the most successful automobile producers in the world.
                 On May 28, 1937, the predecessor to today’s Volkswagen Group, 
                 “Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH,” or “Corporation to prepare the way for the German People’s Car” was established in Berlin.
                  A company, whose history began with the production of the Beetle, has developed over the past 80 years into a global player with 12 brands, 120 production sites on four continents, more than 620,000 employees and more than 10 million vehicles sold per year.

            <p>AVolkswagen was originally founded in 1937 and operated by the German trade union, 
                the German Labor Front. Volkswagen was headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany.
                 The project’s objective was the development and mass production of a reasonably priced yet still speedy automobile that could sell for less than 1,000 Reich marks (approximately $140 at the time).
                  Known as Volkswagenwerk, or "The People's Car Company" at the time, to provide the design for this "people's car," the German Labor Front called in the Austrian automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche.

                   <p>
                    However, shortly after the KdF (Kraft-durch-Freude)-Wagen ("Strength-Through-Joy" car) was presented for the first time at the Berlin Motor Show in 1939, World War II began, and Volkswagen ceased production. After the war ended,
                     with the plant in ruins, the Allies would make Volkswagen the center of their attempts to revive the German auto industry.

                    In 1959, the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach launched an innovative campaign,
                     naming the car the "Beetle" and turning its miniature size as a distinct advantage to consumers.
                      Over the next several years, Volkswagen became the top-selling auto import in the United States.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In 1960, the German government vended 60 percent of Volkswagen's stock to the German public, 
                    successfully denationalizing it. Twelve years later, 
                    the Beetle bettered the longstanding worldwide manufacturing record of 15 million automobiles.
